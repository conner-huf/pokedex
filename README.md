# Pokedex Application

I found this neat, free pokemon data API called [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/), and I thought it would be fun to work with a bit. So I threw together a basic UI and some API calls that I could work with.

As of now, you can type in the name or id number of a pokemon, and the application will display the pokemon's 2D sprite and their stats. This application has basic responsive design to be used on desktop or mobile.

I plan to regularly make additions to this application to implement some other thoughts I have on it that may be neat:
- Move lists
- Habitat of the displayed pokemon
- maybe pokedex entries / descriptions
- Team Creator (with feedback on type weaknesses your team has or some move types that you should consider)
- UI improvements:
-   like displaying a color scheme relevant to the types of the pokemon being displayed.
-   adding buttons to navigate through the added options.
