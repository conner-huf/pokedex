# Pokedex Application

I found this neat, free pokemon data API called [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/), and I thought it would be fun to work with a bit. So I threw together a basic UI and some API calls that I could work with.

As of now, you can type in the name or id number of a pokemon, and the application will display the pokemon's 2D sprite and their stats. This application has basic responsive design to be used on desktop or mobile.

I plan to regularly make additions to this application to implement some other thoughts I have on it that may be neat:
- Move lists
- Habitat of the displayed pokemon
- maybe pokedex entries / descriptions
- Team Creator (with feedback on type weaknesses your team has or some move types that you should consider)
- UI improvements:
-   like displaying a color scheme relevant to the types of the pokemon being displayed.
-   adding buttons to navigate through the added options.

### Update 1/26/24

I've decided to keep a running updated screenshot of what the app is looking like. These can be seen below. The previous screenshots can be found in the screenshot folder. My aim is that there will be a nice journey from rough to (hopefully) polished.
